title: Padrino 0.14.0 - erubi support, no ruby default encodings, cascading option for Rack applications, bug fixes
---


## Remove deprecations planned for 0.14.0

TBE (to be explained)


## Enable cascading with Rack application

In prior versions of Padrino, the core router would cascade from one application to the next on a 404 response even when the application explicitly specified `cascade: false`. With this release, this has been corrected and Padrino will not cascade even if the specified Rack application returns 404.

```ruby
Padrino.mount('RackApp', cascade: false).to('/api') # this will not be cascaded even if returning 404.
Padrino.mount('PadrinoApp::App', app_file: Padrino.root('app/app.rb')).to('/')
```

## Stop managing Ruby default encodings

Default `Encoding.default_internal` is now `nil` (Ruby default) instead of `UTF-8` (`Padrino < 0.14` default)


## Erubis support

Padrino has now [Erubi support](https://github.com/jeremyevans/erubi "erubi support"). Erubi is a ERB template engine
for Ruby. The most significant changes are:


- Handles postfix conditionals when using escaping (e.g. <%= foo if bar %>)
- Supports frozen_string_literal: true in templates via :freeze option
- Automatically freezes strings for template text when ruby optimizes it (on ruby 2.1+)
- Has 6x faster escaping on ruby 2.3+ by using cgi/escape
- Has 86% smaller memory footprint


More details can be found under [erubi](https://github.com/jeremyevans/erubi#erubi "erubi").
