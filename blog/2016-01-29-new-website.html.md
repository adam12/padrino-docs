We finally made it and shipped the new version of Padrino! The [expiring
hosting](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/1964#issuecomment-162437983)) has finally forced us to
switch to the new website. There are still some issues and not everything is working - we try to fix those things in the
future.


This blog post will illustrate the process of the work.


## First draft in 2013

Has been disussed under [as issue 30 on github](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-web-classic/issues/30 "as issue 30 on github") and was created by [Davide D'Agostino](https://github.com/DAddYE "Davide D'Agostino").


There has been several discussions about the colors but the idea and thread ended.


## Next draft and initial version in 2014

The guys from [UXtemple](https://uxtemple.com/ "UXtemple") created the next. Here are some images:

This version looked very promising but a lot of content was missing.


## Further version in November 2014

After some time, [Matthias Günther](https://github.com/wikimatze "Matthias Günther") sat down and started creating a
complete new version of the site in [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "jekyll").


Here are some impressions of the page:

## Further version in January 2015

[middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).

## A big thank you

We have to thank [Darío Javier Cravero](https://github.com/dariocravero "Darío Javier Cravero"),
[Luis Merino](https://github.com/Rendez "Luis Merino"), [Peter Saxton](https://github.com/CrowdHailer "Peter Saxton"),
[Nathan Esquenazi](https://github.com/nesquena "Nathan Esquenazi"), [namusyaka](https://github.com/namusyaka

[Angelo Ashmore](https://github.com/angeloashmore "Angelo Ashmore"), [Davide D'Agostino](https://github.com/DAddYE), and
[Matthias Günther](https://github.com/wikimatze "Matthias Günther") for being involved.

We had several versions of the website and all worked enthusiastically to get the new site up and running. This is
surely a big step forward to Padrino 1.0.0 stable release.
